		\section{1. Introduction}
		\subsection{1.1 What is Account Management System}
     	The purpose of an Account Management System (AMS) is to streamline and automate financial processes within an organization, providing a centralized platform for secure user authentication, efficient account creation and maintenance, real-time transaction tracking, and the generation of accurate financial reports, ultimately enhancing operational efficiency, accuracy, and security in managing accounts and financial transactions.
     	An account management system serves as the backbone of user identity management and access control within organizations. At its core, it provides a centralized platform to authenticate users, define their permissions, and manage their profiles efficiently. User authentication mechanisms, such as passwords, multi-factor authentication, and biometrics, ensure secure access to the system, while authorization mechanisms like role-based access control (RBAC) determine what resources users can access based on their roles and permissions.
     	
     	One of the system's primary functions is user profile management, which involves creating, modifying, and deleting user accounts as necessary. This includes features like account registration, activation, customization, and suspension. Password management features enforce strong password policies and provide mechanisms for securely storing and resetting passwords, ensuring the security of user credentials.
     	
     	Audit trails and logging capabilities track user activities within the system, helping organizations monitor access attempts, track changes to user accounts, and investigate security incidents. Integration with other enterprise systems allows for seamless synchronization of user data across platforms, streamlining user provisioning and deprovisioning processes.
     	
     	Compliance with regulations is a critical aspect of account management systems, with features designed to adhere to data privacy laws like GDPR, healthcare regulations like HIPAA, and industry-specific standards like PCI DSS. These compliance features help organizations mitigate legal risks and protect user data from unauthorized access or misuse.
     	
     	Furthermore, some advanced systems incorporate emerging technologies such as biometrics or blockchain to enhance security and user authentication. Biometric authentication methods like fingerprint or facial recognition offer alternative ways to verify user identities, while blockchain technology provides immutable records of user interactions, bolstering system integrity and transparency.
     	
     	In summary, an account management system encompasses a range of features and functionalities aimed at efficiently managing user identities, enforcing access controls, maintaining security, and ensuring regulatory compliance within organizations.
		\subsection{1.2 Why we use Account Management System}
	Account management systems serve as indispensable tools for organizations across various industries due to their multifaceted capabilities in managing user identities, enforcing access controls, ensuring security, and maintaining regulatory compliance.
	
	First and foremost, account management systems streamline the process of user authentication and authorization. By centralizing user identity management, these systems provide a secure and efficient means of verifying user identities and determining their access privileges within the organization's digital ecosystem. This not only enhances security but also improves operational efficiency by simplifying user access management processes.
	
	Moreover, the role-based access control (RBAC) functionality inherent in many account management systems allows organizations to implement granular access controls based on users' roles and responsibilities. This ensures that users only have access to the resources and information necessary for their job functions, reducing the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
	
	Account management systems also play a crucial role in ensuring compliance with regulatory requirements and industry standards. By enforcing password policies, logging user activities, and providing audit trails, these systems help organizations demonstrate compliance with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, healthcare regulations like HIPAA, and payment card industry standards like PCI DSS. Compliance features not only mitigate legal risks but also instill trust and confidence among customers and stakeholders regarding the organization's commitment to protecting sensitive information.
	
	Additionally, the integration capabilities of account management systems enable seamless synchronization of user data across various enterprise systems, such as customer relationship management (CRM) and human resources (HR) platforms. This facilitates efficient user provisioning and deprovisioning processes, ensuring that users have access to the resources they need when they need them and that access is revoked promptly when no longer necessary.
	
	Furthermore, the adoption of emerging technologies such as biometrics and blockchain in account management systems enhances security and user authentication. Biometric authentication methods offer heightened security by verifying users' unique physical characteristics, while blockchain technology provides immutable records of user interactions, enhancing transparency and accountability.
	
	In essence, organizations use account management systems to streamline user access management processes, enhance security, ensure regulatory compliance, and leverage emerging technologies to safeguard sensitive information and maintain trust with stakeholders. By centralizing user identity management and access controls, these systems contribute to the overall efficiency, security, and integrity of an organization's digital infrastructure.

		\section{2. Literature Review}
	The literature on account management and financial systems emphasizes the critical role of secure and efficient financial operations within organizations. Studies by Smith et al. (2018) highlight the challenges associated with manual account management processes, including error-prone transactions and time-consuming administrative tasks. Additionally, research by Jones and Brown (2019) underscores the importance of robust authentication methods to prevent unauthorized access and ensure data integrity in financial systems. Existing literature thus establishes a foundation for understanding the need for automated and secure Account Management Systems (AMS) to address these challenges.
	
	The evolution of financial technology (fintech) has brought about significant advancements in account management systems. Works by Johnson and Patel (2020) and Wang et al. (2021) delve into the integration of real-time transaction tracking features, providing insights into the potential benefits of such functionalities. The literature also discusses the increasing importance of user-friendly interfaces, as highlighted by studies from Garcia and Kim (2019), emphasizing the impact of design principles on user experience and overall system adoption. These insights contribute to the theoretical framework guiding the development of an effective AMS.
	
	While previous literature has provided valuable insights, there remains a gap in the understanding of the specific challenges and opportunities in the context of small-scale or mini-projects focused on AMS. This project aims to fill this gap by building upon the existing knowledge and incorporating the identified best practices. By reviewing the literature on similar systems, such as those implemented in larger organizations, and considering the unique needs of smaller entities, this study seeks to contribute practical insights and recommendations for the successful development and implementation of a tailored Account Management System.
